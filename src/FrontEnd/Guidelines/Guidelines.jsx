            Welcome to MindRest! We're dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive,
            and supportive platform for individuals seeking mental health
            support and therapy. To ensure the well-being of all our users and
            maintain the integrity of our community, we've established the
            following comprehensive guidelines:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal">
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Respect and Empathy:</strong> Treat everyone with respect,
              empathy, and kindness. Be mindful of your language and
              interactions with therapists and fellow users. Harassment,
              bullying, discrimination, or any form of abusive behavior will not
              be tolerated.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Confidentiality and Privacy:</strong> Your privacy is
              paramount. All therapy sessions and communications between you and
              your therapist are strictly confidential. Do not share personal
              information, screenshots, or any content from therapy sessions
              without explicit consent. Respect the privacy of others and
              refrain from sharing their personal information.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Open and Honest Communication:</strong> Foster open and
              honest communication with your therapist. Share your thoughts,
              feelings, and experiences openly, as this is essential for
              effective therapy. Your therapist is here to provide support,
              guidance, and validation in a safe, non-judgmental space.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Active Participation and Engagement:</strong> Take an
              active role in your therapy journey. Engage fully in therapy
              sessions, complete any assigned exercises or homework, and
              implement strategies discussed with your therapist in your daily
              life. Active participation leads to meaningful progress and
              growth.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Professionalism and Boundaries:</strong> Our therapists
              adhere to professional standards of practice and ethics. They
              maintain appropriate boundaries and prioritize your well-being. If
              you have concerns about your therapist's conduct, boundaries, or
              approach, please communicate openly or contact us for assistance.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Feedback and Continuous Improvement:</strong> Your
              feedback is invaluable to us. If you have suggestions for
              improvement, encounter any issues, or have concerns about the
              platform or therapy experience, please don't hesitate to reach
              out. We're committed to continuous improvement and enhancing your
              experience on MindRest.

              <strong>Safety and Crisis Intervention:</strong> MindRest is not
              intended for crisis intervention. If you're experiencing a mental
              health crisis, thoughts of self-harm, or harm to others, seek
              immediate help. Contact emergency services or a crisis hotline for
              immediate assistance. Remember, your safety and well-being are our
              top priorities.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Cultural Sensitivity and Diversity:</strong> Embrace
              diversity and cultural sensitivity. MindRest is committed to
              providing inclusive therapy services that respect and celebrate
              individual differences. We value diversity in all its forms and
              strive to create a welcoming and affirming environment for
              everyone.

              <strong>Digital Etiquette and Community Guidelines:</strong> When
              interacting with therapists and other users on MindRest, adhere to
              common digital etiquette practices. Avoid sharing sensitive or
              triggering content without proper content warnings. Respect the
              diverse backgrounds and beliefs of others. Refrain from engaging
              in disruptive behavior that may detract from the therapeutic
              experience of others.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">
              <strong>Self-Advocacy and Personal Responsibility:</strong> Take
              ownership of your mental health journey and advocate for your
              needs. Be proactive in communicating your preferences, goals, and
              boundaries with your therapist. Participate actively in the
              therapy process and commit to your self-care and well-being
              outside of therapy sessions.
